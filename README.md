## Shivakar's dotfiles

*Warning*: You should never blindly use someone else's dotfiles without reviewing and understanding the code. Use at your own risk!! Setup does things like add my SSH keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. It would be better to take inspiration, copy or fork the repo and make it your own.

## Prerequisites

For MacOS:
* [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is expected to be installed and working correctly.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivakar/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
make
```
